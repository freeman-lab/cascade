Cascade
=======

Library for fitting neural encoding models

## About

Imagine we measures the response of a neuron to several simultaneous stimulus and behavioral variables. This toolbox fits a family of cascade models with both linear and nonlinear stages, including NL, LN, and NLN, using maximum likelihood.

## Use

The fitting routines require an input structure d, which contains at the minimum, the following fields:

	t - time points per trial
	k - number of trials (can be 1 if no trial structure)
	u - upsampling factor for stimulus
	c - number of stimuli (or behavioral variables)
	samp - temporal sampling of stimulus / response ('same" or 'up')
	S_ctk - matrix of stimuli / behaviors x time points x trials
	R_ntk - matrix neurons x time points x trials

Fits are generated by calling:

	fit = fitInit(d,'NL','loglik',20);
	d = prepareStim(d,fit);
	[train test] = prepareRoi(d,fit,1);
	fit = fitDo(train,test,fit);

## To-Do

incorporate an output nonlinearity (fitG)
